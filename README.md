## Phase 3 Notes
- compile DFA.java: `javac phase3/DFA.java phase3/ExpTree.java phase3/Alphabet.java`
- compile REMatcher.java: `javac phase3/REMatcher.java phase3/DFA.java phase3/ExpTree.java phase3/Alphabet.java`
- compile Tester.java: `javac phase3/Tester.java phase3/REMatcher.java phase3/DFA.java phase3/ExpTree.java phase3/Alphabet.java`
- DFA.java can be run to view the transitions of a tree that is created. REMatcher.java can be used to see if any word matches any DFA. Tester.java is used to run multiple words on a somewhat complex DFA, as well as giving runtime and spacetime efficencies.
